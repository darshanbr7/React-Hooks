Use Effect is is used to control the side effect in class components
= use Effect hook is a Close replacement for "component Did mount" ,"component did unmount","component will unmount"

useEffect run after evevry render
syntax :
  useEffect(callback function)
  useEffect(()=>{})  == this is eqivalent to component Did mount, and component did update methods in class 
  
  for avoid unneccessary rendering we add the dependency  as a second argument to useEffect hook
  syntax :
    useEffect(()=>{},[value])
